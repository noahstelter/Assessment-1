/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added."
var Analysis of Requirements = "The analysis stage includes gathering all the specific details required for a new system as well as determining the first ideas for prototypes."
var design = "The design stage is a necessary precursor to the main developer stage. Developers will first outline the details for the overall application"
var testing and integration = "During the testing stage, developers will go over their software with a fine-tooth comb, noting any bugs or defects that need to be tracked, fixed, and later retested"
var implementation = "After testing, the overall design for the software will come together. The information system will be integrated into its environment and eventually installed."
var maintain = "Developers must now move into a maintenance mode and begin practicing any activities required to handle issues reported by end-users. Developers are responsible for implementing any changes that the software might need after deployment."
